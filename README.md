This is a collection of very simple micro benchmarks written in C++ and tested via google Benchmark and perf in linux. These tests are inspired by real life scenarios but individually far from real and written to provide only hint and guidance. 

T&C : Author's original work is totally free, from every respect but any restrictions applied by goole Benchmark license may apply.
