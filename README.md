# ShortPerfs
This is a collection of very simple micro benchmarks written in C++ and tested using google Benchmark and perf in linux. These tests are inspired by real life scenarios but individually far from real and written to provide only hint and guidance. 

Every file name has the following format :<br/>
broadercontext_localcontext_num.cpp<br/>
Where broadercontext represents a the theme of investigation where as optional localcontext represents any specific implementation under the broadercontext. Files have a number(number) which may be chronological or by logical continuation.  

T&C : Author's original work is totally free, from every respect but any restrictions applied by goole Benchmark license may apply.
